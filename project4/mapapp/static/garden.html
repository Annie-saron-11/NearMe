                Nestled just on the outskirts of T. Kallikulam, GM Garden is a serene 
                open-lawn venue framed by swaying palms and soft ambient lighting. 
                The grounds span a gently undulating green carpet, ideal for evening functions 
                and small celebrations under the stars. A shaded pergola on one side serves 
                as a cosy outdoor lounge for guests, while the adjoining enclosed hall 
                features floor-to-ceiling glass doors that open directly onto the lawn, 
                connecting indoor comfort with outdoor charm
